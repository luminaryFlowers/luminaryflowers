### hello!

i'm a compsci student in vancouver with an interest in game and web dev and a distaste for capitalization!

- 🐢 pronouns: he/they
- 🌱 currently (slowly) working on my solo game project: a story-based action rpg in unreal called *then;again*, about an amnesiac and a god investigating stray memories
- 🔭 currently doing contract work!
